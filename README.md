## 🧐 Problem Addressed:
During the course of the pandemic, E-learning has proven to be an efficient an effective mode of learning. For the past year, students have been stuck in their homes attending classes online. Often, these classes are boring and lack engagement making it harder for students to retain what they have learned. Courses with practical or hands-on elements are especially challenging to teach online. This makes the ability to visualize crucial in subjects such as Aerospace, Biology, and many others. With this application, we focus on solving the problem of visualization in online classes by using 3D, Augmented reality to give life-like simulations of various models and make the learning process more impactful and engaging. With built-in interactivity, students can ask questions synchronously and get instant feedback.
